The ASP.NET Core project templates enable a feature named implicit usings, which define global using
statements for these commonly required namespaces:

```txt
System
System.Collections.Generic
System.IO
System.Linq
System.Net.Http
System.Net.Http.Json
System.Threading
System.Threading.Tasks
Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder
Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting
Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http
Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing
Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration
Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection
Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting
Microsoft.Extensions.Logging
```

_using_ statements are not required for these namespaces, which are available throughout the
application. These namespaces donâ€™t cover all of the ASP.NET Core features, but they do cover the basics,
which is why no explicit using statements are required in the Program.cs file, for example.
