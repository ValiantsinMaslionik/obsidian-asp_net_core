# **IF + PRESENT TENSE | WILL + INFINITIVE**

The first conditional describes a probable future situation. 
If the condition is fulfilled, the action in the main clause **is likely to happen**:

- *If we **don't leave** soon, we **will miss** the train.*  
- *If you **ask** him, he **will** probably **help** you.*  

In this type of conditional, **the present tenses in the if-clause usually refer to future time** and their use is similar to that in future time clauses.
Sometimes, however, **a present tense in the if-clause can refer to present time**:

- If you **are** hungry, you'll find some sandwiches in the fridge.

Compare the zero and the first conditionals:

- *If I **drink** too much, I usually **get** a hangover the following day.* 
Zero conditional to refer to a general situation; one action is always followed by another.

- *If I **drink** too much, I **will get** a hangover tomorrow.* 
First conditional to refer to one specific future situation.

# Present continuous in the first conditional

The present continuous can be used in the if-clause of a sentence in the first conditional to refer to a present action or a future arrangement:

- *If you **are looking** for Molly, you'll find her upstairs in her room.*
Present action
- *If you **are staying** for the weekend, we'll go to the cinema.*
Future arrangement

# Present perfect in the first conditional

The present perfect in the if-clause of a sentence in the first conditional emphasizes that one action depends on the completion of another:

- *If I**'ve finished** writing my paper by tonight, I'll go out with my friends.*

# Imperatives in the first conditional

Imperatives can be used to replace either clause of the first conditional:

- *If you've done the dishes, please **mop** the floor.*  
- ***Tidy up** your room, and you can go out to play football with your friends.*

# Modals in the first conditional

## Main clause

We can use modals other than *will* in the main clause of a sentence in the first conditional:

- **\[Possibility\]** *If you ask George, he **<span style="color: lime;">may(might) be</span>** able to help you.*
- **\[Permission\]** *You **<span style="color: lime;">can(may) leave</span>** the room if you've finished the test.*
- **\[Obligation\]** *If he doesn't come soon, we **<span style="color: lime;">must(will) have to leave</span>** without him.*
- **\[Suggestion\]** *If you ever go to Chicago, you **<span style="color: lime;">should take</span>** a boat trip on the river.*
- **\[Prediction\]** *If you don't watch your steps, you **<span style="color: lime;">are going to fall</span>are going to fall** over.*

## If-clause

- We can use *be going* to in the if-clause **to express intention**:
*If you **are going to speak** like that, you'll have to leave.*

- *Should* in the if-clause makes the condition **less likely**:
*If you **should see** Kate, say hi from me.*

- In the if-clause, **willingness** can be expressed by *will* and refusal by *won't*.  In this sense *will* and *won't* are always stressed in speech and cannot be contracted with the subject in writing:
*If you **will take** me to the airport tomorrow, I won't have to take a taxi.*
*If Greg **won't answer** the phone, I'll speak to his roommate.*

- We can also use *will* in the if-clause to express a **polite request**. Sometimes the main clause is omitted:
- *If you **will wait** for a moment, I'll see if Mr. Hawking is available.*  
- *If you**'ll** just **fill in** this form, please.*
