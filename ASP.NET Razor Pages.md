==One drawback of the MVC Framework is that it can require a lot of preparatory work before an application
can start producing content.== Despite its structural problems, one advantage of Web Pages was that simple
applications could be created in a couple of hours.

#Term/Razor_Pages takes the development ethos of Web Pages and implements it using the platform features
originally developed for the MVC Framework. Code and content are mixed to form self-contained pages;
this re-creates the speed of Web Pages development without some of the underlying technical problems
(although the issue of scaling up complex projects can still be an issue).

==Razor Pages can be used alongside the MVC Framework, which is how I tend to use them.== I write the
main parts of the application using the MVC Framework and use Razor Pages for the secondary features,
such as administration and reporting tools. You can see this approach in Chapters 7â€“11 #TODO/AddLink, where I develop a
realistic ASP.NET Core application called SportsStore.
