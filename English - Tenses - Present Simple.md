The **Present Simple tense** is the most basic tense in English and uses the base form of the verb (except for the verb _be_). The only change from the base is the addition of **s** for third person singular.

## How do we use the Present Simple tense?

We use the Present Simple to talk about:

- a routine : _I go Berlin once a month_.
- a though/feeling/reaction rather than action : _Yes, I remember._
- for schedule
- general time  - action verbs
- general time and situations now  - verb "be"
- situations now ([stative](https://www.englishclub.com/grammar/verbs-classification-main.php) verbs)
- something always or permanent true : _It only takes 20 minutes to get to the station_.
- the future after a time word (when, after, etc.) : _We can meet when I get back._

### Present Simple for general time

We use the Present Simple tense when:

- the action is general
- the action happens all the time, or habitually, in the past, present and future
- the action is not only happening now
- the statement is always true

### Present Simple for now

Stative verbs do not describe action. They describe state, and are verbs such as: _like, sound, belong to, need, seem_. We can use these verbs with the Present Simple tense to talk about a situation at the present time, not general.

### Present Simple for general time and now

The verb **be** is always special. It is a stative verb, and we use it in the Present Simple tense to talk about **now** situations _and_ about **general** situations. Look at these examples of the verb _be_ in the Present Simple tense - some are **general** and some are **now**:

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|I **am** not fat.  <br>Why **are** you so beautiful?  <br>Ram **is** tall.|   |   |
|**past**|**present**|**future**|
||   |   |
|The situation is general. Past, present and future.|   |   |

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Am** I right?  <br>Tara **is** not at home.  <br>We **are** hungry.|   |   |
|**past**|**present**|**future**|
||   |   |
||The situation is now.||

## Present Simple for Schedule

When an event is on a schedule or timetable (for example, the take-off time for a plane), we often use the **present simple** to express the future. We usually also use a future phrase (expressed or understood) like _tomorrow_, _at 6.30pm_, _next week_.

Only a few verbs are used in this way, for example:

- _be, open, close, begin, start, end, finish, arrive, come, leave, return_

Look at these sentences:

- The train **leaves** Detroit at 9pm **tonight**.
- John **starts** work **next week**.
- **Tomorrow** **is** Thursday.

## How do we make the Present Simple tense?

There are two basic structures for the Present Simple:

1. Positive sentences

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|subject|+|main verb|
|||**Present Simple**|

2. Negative and question sentences

|   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|subject|+|auxiliary _do_|+|main verb|
|||conjugated in Present Simple|||
|**do, does**|**base**|

Look at these examples with the main verb _like_:

||**subject**|**auxiliary verb**||**main verb**||
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|+|I, you, we, they|||like|coffee.|
|He, she, it|||like**s**|coffee.|
|-|I, you, we, they|do|not|like|coffee.|
|He, she, it|do**es**|not|like|coffee.|
|?|Do|I, you, we, they||like|coffee?|
|Do**es**|he, she, it||like|coffee?|

From the above table, notice the following points...

For positive sentences:

- There is **no auxiliary verb**.
- We conjugate the main verb by adding **s** to the third person singular.

For negative and question sentences:

- The auxiliary verb (do) is conjugated in the Present Simple: _do, does_
- The main verb is invariable in base form: _base_
- For negative sentences, we insert **not** between the auxiliary verb and the main verb.
- For question sentences, we **exchange** the subject and the auxiliary verb.

**Emphatic _do_**  
Normally, for positive sentences we do not use the auxiliary verb _do_. But if we want to emphasize (stress) something, we may use it. For example, instead of saying "I like your dress", we could say "I do like your dress", just to show how much we like it. Here are some more examples:

- I do wish you'd stop.
- I do apologize.
- You do look smart today.

### Present Simple with main verb _be_

The structure of the Present Simple with the main verb _be_ is:

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|subject|+|main verb _be_|
|||conjugated in Present Simple|
|**am, are, is**|

Look at these examples with the main verb _be_:

||**subject**|**main verb _be_**|||
|---|---|---|---|---|
|+|I|am||French.|
|You, we, they|are||French.|
|He, she, it|is||French.|
|-|I|am|not|old.|
|You, we, they|are|not|old.|
|He, she, it|is|not|old.|
|?|Am|I||late?|
|Are|you, we, they||late?|
|Is|he, she, it||late?|

From the above table, notice the following points...

- There is **no auxiliary verb**, even for questions and negatives.
- The main verb (be) is conjugated in the Present Simple: _am, are, is_
- For negative sentences, we insert **not** after the main verb.
- For question sentences, we **exchange** the subject and the main verb.
