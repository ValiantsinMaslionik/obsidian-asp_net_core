The **Present Simple tense** is the most basic tense in English and uses the base form of the verb (except for the verb _be_). The only change from the base is the addition of **s** for third person singular.

## How do we use the Present Simple tense?

We use the Present Simple to talk about:

- a routine : _I go Berlin once a month_.
- a though/feeling/reaction rather than action : _Yes, I remember._
- for schedule
- general time  - action verbs
- general time and situations now  - verb "be"
- situations now ([stative](https://www.englishclub.com/grammar/verbs-classification-main.php) verbs)
- something always or permanent true : _It only takes 20 minutes to get to the station_.
- the future after a time word (when, after, etc.) : _We can meet when I get back._

### Present Simple for general time

We use the Present Simple tense when:

- the action is general
- the action happens all the time, or habitually, in the past, present and future
- the action is not only happening now
- the statement is always true

### Present Simple for now

Stative verbs do not describe action. They describe state, and are verbs such as: _like, sound, belong to, need, seem_. We can use these verbs with the Present Simple tense to talk about a situation at the present time, not general.

### Present Simple for general time and now

For [stative](https://www.englishclub.com/grammar/verbs-classification-main.php) verbs, we can use the Present Simple to talk about **now**. Stative verbs do not describe action. They describe state, and are verbs such as: _like, sound, belong to, need, seem_. We can use these verbs with the Present Simple tense to talk about a situation at the present time, not general.

### Present Simple for Schedule

When an event is on a schedule or timetable (for example, the take-off time for a plane), we often use the **present simple** to express the future. We usually also use a future phrase (expressed or understood) like _tomorrow_, _at 6.30pm_, _next week_.

Only a few verbs are used in this way, for example:

- _be, open, close, begin, start, end, finish, arrive, come, leave, return_

Look at these sentences:

- The train **leaves** Detroit at 9pm **tonight**.
- John **starts** work **next week**.
- **Tomorrow** **is** Thursday.

### Emphatic _do_

Normally, for positive sentences we do not use the auxiliary verb _do_. But if we want to emphasize (stress) something, we may use it. For example, instead of saying "I like your dress", we could say "I do like your dress", just to show how much we like it. Here are some more examples:

- I do wish you'd stop.
- I do apologize.
- You do look smart today.
