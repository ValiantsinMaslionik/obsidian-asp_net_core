# Unless

*Unless* is used to express a condition that **must** be met for a particular situation to happen or for something to be true in the future.
On the other hand, '**if...not**' is used when discussing a situation that has not occurred or when something is known to be untrue in the present or the past.

- *If you don't help me, I won't be able to lift this == I won't be able to lift this <span style="color: lime;">unless</span> you help me.*
- *<span style="color: lime;">unless</span> something unexpected happens, we go to work tomorrow*.
- *The garden party is on <span style="color: lime;">unless</span> it rains.* 

# Otherwise

*Otherwise* is another way of saying *if not*. It can also come at the end of a separate tense.

- *Help me with this, <span style="color: lime;">otherwise</span> I won't be able to lift it.*
- *Help me with this, I won't be able to lift it <span style="color: lime;">otherwise</span>.*

# If only

Can be used as a way of emphasizing *if*
*<span style="color: lime;">If only</span> you'd told me, I could have helped you.*

Can also be used alone as an exclamation
*<span style="color: lime;">If only</span> you'd told me!*

### Provided / Providing (that) / As long as / On condition (that)

There are more emphatic ways of saying *only ... if*
- **You can <span style="color: lime;">only</span> go to the party, <span style="color: lime;">if</span> you are home before 10:00.**
- *You can go to the party, <span style="color: lime;">provided you are home</span> before 10:00.*
- *You can go to the party, <span style="color: lime;">as long as you are home</span> before 10:00.*
- *You can go to the party, <span style="color: lime;">on condition that yo are home</span> before 10:00.*

# Even if

Also can be used as a way of emphasizing *if*
- <span style="color: lime;">Even if you begged him</span> to take the money he wouldn't accept.

# If (you) should ... If you happen to ...

*If-should* emphasizes that an event is not very likely, or to make a request seem more indirect or polite
*<span style="color: lime;">If you should see</span> him tomorrow could you give him my message?*

*If-happen to* has a similar effect and can be used with *should* to emphasis unlikelihood or distance.
Phases such as *by any chance* are also used in the same way.
*<span style="color: lime;">If you happen to be</span> in the neighborhood do drop and see us.*
*<span style="color: lime;">If you should happen by any chance</span> to find the money, can you send it back?*

# If (I) were to ...

This is often used in writing which speculates about the future
*If the government <span style="color: lime;">were to lower</span> taxes they would certainly win votes.*

This can also make an event seem less likely
*<span style="color: lime;">If I were to offer you</span> more money would you stay in the job?*

# If (it) were / was not for / hadn't been for ...

This describes how one event depends on another

*<span style="color: lime;">If it were not for Helen</span> our team would be the worst in the area!*
(If Helen wasn't a really good player...)

*<span style="color: lime;">If it hadn't been for Jim</span> the child would have drowned.*
(If Jim hadn't jumped in to rescue the child...)

# But for

We can use *but for* to mean "if it were not for"
*<span style="color: lime;">But for</span> your assistance, we would not have succeeded. 

# Supposing, suppose, imagine

These are ways of expressing conditions without *if*
*<span style="color: lime;">Supposing you had</span> one million. What would you spend on?*
*<span style="color: lime;">Imagine you were</span> president. How would you change the country?*

# If so / If not

These can refer to a previous sentence and form a condition
**If Jean is too ill to play, Mary can play instead.**
*Jean may be too ill to play. <span style="color: lime;">If so, Mary can play</span> instead.*
*Jean may still be able to play. <span style="color: lime;">If not, Mary can play</span> instead.*

# Leaving out if

In everyday speech we can use an *imperative phrase + and + will* clause instead of an *if* conditional sentence.
**If you come over here, I'll show you what I mean.**
<span style="color: lime;">Come over here and I'll</span> show you what I mean.

# If + adjective

In everyday speech, we can leave out the verb *to be* in phases with adjectives such as *interested*, *necessary* etc.
**If you are interested, phone this number.**
*<span style="color: lime;">If interested</span>, phone this number.*

# If I might, If I can / could

*Might* and *can/could* are used in an if-clause which stands alone as a very polite request.
*<span style="color: lime;">If I could just have</span> another look.*
(Could I have another look?)

*<span style="color: lime;">If I might help</span> you with your coat?*

# Had (I) ..., Where (I)..., Should I ...

It is possible to begin formal conditional sentences by inverting *had* or *where* or *should* and the subject, leaving out *if*.

## Inversion in the first conditional

To invert sentences in the first conditional, we place the auxiliary _should_ **before** the subject, followed by the infinitive of the main verb: _should + subject + infinitive_.
*<span style="color: lime;">Should you book</span> with us again, we will provide you with a 3% discount.* 
(**If you book with us again, …**)

## Inversion in the second conditional

> ![[zICO - Warning - 16.png]] Generally speaking, it is uncommon to use inversion in second conditional sentences. 
> Inverted second conditional if-clauses are often restricted to formal, written English.

In second conditionals, inversion is used to rewrite if-clauses that contain the verb _be._ Use the structure _were + subject_.

*<span style="color: lime;">Were this</span> my hotel, I <span style="color: lime;">would be</span> ashamed!*
(**If this were my hotel, …**)

When the if-clause refers to **an unlikely future event**, we use the inversion _were + subject + **to** + infinitive._ We can use this structure with verbs other than _be._

<span style="color: lime;">Were I</span> to leave a review one day, it would be 1 star!
(**If I left a review, … (at some point in the future)**)

## Inversion in the third conditional

To invert [third conditional](https://english.lingolia.com/en/grammar/third-conditional) if-clauses, use the structure _had + subject + [past participle](https://english.lingolia.com/en/grammar/verbs/participles)_.

*<span style="color: lime;">Had we known</span> about the bed bug infestation, we never <span style="color: lime;">would have</span> given you that room.*
(**If we had known about the bed bug infestation, …**)

> ![[zICO - Exclamation - 16.png]] Do not use contractions in negative inverted conditionals.
>
> *Had the hotel not been so awful, I would have enjoyed myself.*
> _not:_ ~~Hadn’t the hotel been so awful, …~~

## _Were it not for_

The idiomatic phrase _were it not for_ is also an example of an inverted conditional. It means _without._

*Were it not for the building work, the pool area would be open.* (second conditional meaning)
(**If it weren’t for the building work, …**)

*Were it not for the quick actions of guests such as yourself, the fire would have been much worse.* (third conditional meaning)
(**If it hadn’t been for the quick actions …**)
