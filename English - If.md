_'If'_ is both a **[Conjunction](https://langeek.co/en/grammar/course/503/conjunctions)** and a **[Noun](https://langeek.co/en/grammar/course/494/nouns)**. However, it mostly functions as a **conjunction**.

# 'If' as a Conjunction

## When we have [[English - Conditionals]]:

- *Just tell me __if__ you need money.* 
This is the **zero** conditional sentence.

- *The baby will not be safe __if__ you leave him with his aunt.* 
This is the **first** conditional.

- *If I had your money, I wouldn't be living with my parents anymore.* 
 This is the **second** conditional.

- *If I hadn't found a job, my parents would have scolded me.* 
 This is **third** conditional.

- *If they hadn't worked that hard, they wouldn't have been so sad right now.* 
This is the **mixed** conditional.

## When we want to mention something that we are not certain about

- *I don't know **if** I'm ever able to trust anyone again*. 
- *My mother doubts **if** I ever forgive her*. 

## When we want to show our feelings for someone in a situation

- *I won't continue **if** it makes you sad.* 
- *I'm sorry **if** I hurt you with my words.* 

## When we want to show that what we have just said is even worse or better

- *She was making everything extremely difficult, **if** not impossible, between us.* 
- *Your father has changed a little, **if** at all, since I last saw him*. 

## We can use 'if' to show that although something might/might not be true, it is not important.

- *My only weakness, **if** it is even considered a weakness, is caring for others.* 
- *Persephone's one and only flaw, **if** you can call it a flaw, is her love for the darkness.* 

> #### ![[zICO - Warning - 16.png]] If vs. Whether
>
> Although 'if' and 'whether' can sometimes be used interchangeably, there are some cases in which they cannot.
> 
> - With the [verb](https://langeek.co/en/grammar/course/496/verbs) 'discuss':
> *We were __<span style="color: lime;">discussing whether</span>__ we could change the time of our class or not.* 
>
> - When we have an [infinitive](https://langeek.co/en/grammar/course/669/infinitives):
> *Probably he doesn't know __<span style="color: lime;">whether to believe</span>__ you or not.* 
>
> - When we have a [preposition](https://langeek.co/en/grammar/course/502/prepositions):
> *Why don't you think __<span style="color: lime;">about whether</span>__ you like it or not?* 
>
> #### ![[zICO - Exclamation - 16.png]] Warning!
> 
> Please note that when we use 'if' at the beginning of the dependent clause, we must always have a comma before the independent clause begins:
> *If she dares challenge me<span style="color: lime;">, she will burn in the flames of hell</span>.* 

# 'If' as a Noun

Sometimes 'if' can function as a noun. It is mostly used when we want to show that something may/may not happen. Take a look:
- *I wonder why I can raise many ifs and buts in your suggestion.* 
- *Angela said she could help me if I kept silent, and it's a big if.* 

> #### Position in a sentence
>
> Since 'if' here is a noun, it can come as the [subject](https://langeek.co/en/grammar/course/64/subject), the [object](https://langeek.co/en/grammar/course/65/object) of the verb, or the [object of a preposition](https://langeek.co/en/grammar/course/511/objects-of-prepositions). Look at the following examples for more clarification:
>
> - 'if' has been used as the object of the verb.
> *I'm no more interested in hearing your ifs and buts in my opinion.* 
>
> - Here, 'if' has been used as the object of the sentence.
> *Ifs and buts are for losers.* 

# Spoken Uses of 'if'

There are occasions in which we can use 'if' differently in spoken English.

# Idioms and Expressions with 'If'

- If necessary: When we want to state that an action must be done if necessary:
*Text me if necessary.*

- If only: This idiom is used to express a wish or regret and also to show that something must be done even if for no other reason that what was mentioned. Look:
