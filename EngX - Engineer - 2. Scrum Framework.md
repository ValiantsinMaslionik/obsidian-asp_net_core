# Overview

Scrum is a framework that unites business and development. It focuses on teams delivering products of the highest value while also being productive and efficient.

On a Scrum team, there are generally two sides of a project: 
- **business** - is typically represented by a **Product Owner (PO)**, who is accountable for maximizing the product's value resulting from the Scrum team’s work. The **PO** communicates with key stakeholders and is responsible for the product backlog.
- **development** - is represented by the whole development team, with the **Scrum Master** facilitating Scrum practices and helping the development team monitor and improve their workflow.

Implementing the Scrum framework means adhering to short, timeboxed iterations called **<span style="color:lime;">Sprints</span>**. 
Working in Sprints gives teams multiple opportunities to get fast feedback at different levels. During each Sprint, teams participate in multiple events. 

**<span style="color:lime;">Daily Scrums</span>** - brief check-ins that occur each day; enable team members to assess how successfully they are moving toward the Sprint goal. 

Other events that occur once per Sprint include:
- **Sprint Planning:** - an event when all team members initiate the Sprint by laying out the work to perform
- **Sprint Review:** - a timeboxed working session when the team and key stakeholders review the outcomes of a Sprint and identify future steps
- **Sprint Retrospective:** - an event when team members discuss what went well, what could be improved, and commit to improvements in the next Sprint

Engaging in these events enables your team to communicate openly about your progress, share and discuss feedback, and remain adaptive to changing needs and requirements.

# Three Pillars of Scrum

All Scrum events support the three Scrum pillars: transparency, inspection, and adaptation.

### Transparency

Transparency requires all team members to be included in all activities required for a project. Events like *Daily Scrums* support this pillar. This pillar requires all members of the team to embrace openness and trust, while working toward a common goal.

### Inspection

Inspection ensures that teams prioritize tasks and that the product is of high quality. Events like *Sprint Reviews* support this pillar. This pillar requires flexibility and collaboration between the team and the customer to ensure the best possible product.

### Adaptation

Adaptation is apparent across all Scrum events. It focuses on one of the main aspects of being Agile, which is to always be flexible to accommodate the project and customers’ needs. Any changes identified in the *Inspection pillar* should be accommodated during Adaptation, with continued flexibility and collaboration between the team and the customer.

**Keep the three pillars in mind as you begin to introduce Scrum to your team**. The specific ways in which you implement the practices are less important than ensuring transparency and flexibility while maintaining a focus on quality.

# Tips for Implementing Scrum

If Scrum is new to you and your team, these tips can help you begin to integrate the framework and experience the benefits.

### Define Scrum Elements

It is key to align on the different elements of Scrum at the start of any project to keep everyone on the same page. For example, the duration of each Sprint may be different from project to project even though it is generally somewhere between one and four weeks.

### Prioritize Tasks

A backlog of items can quickly become unorganized if your team does not prioritize them. Knowing about how long certain tasks take and how important they are will keep Sprints on track and focused.

> **Backlog** - A list of new features, changes, bug fixes, or other activities that a team may deliver to achieve a specific outcome.

### Make Progress Visible

Daily scrums are one way to monitor progress and adapt sprint goals as necessary. By applying a **“walk the board”** approach, you and your team walk the board from right to left to call out what tasks are in progress for each item and collaborate on how to complete them. It will also allow the team to discuss which tasks they plan to pick up next. After walking the board, the *Scrum Master* can still ask if anyone has other comments or impediments to mention.

# Questions

Sarah leads a development team. She believes in Agile ways of working, and she wants her team to think in new ways and incorporate Agile values and principles in their work. 
-> Encourage experimentation with new solutions

Alex is an Agile expert at his organization and the go-to professional for advice on how to solve problems through an Agile approach. The problems below are just a few of the issues that colleagues describe to Alex.
1. Projects continue to be more and more expensive. Developers and project managers feel pressure to eliminate unnecessary work in order to control costs. -> Focus on most valuable features to control cost.
2. Teams are currently struggling to keep up with market demands. Releasing solutions takes a great deal of time and resources, and some of the solutions don’t actually address the needs of the end user. -> Releasing iterative solutions to the market
3. Project teams have been seeing lots of issues and defects in their code. Making changes is difficult, and teams struggle to adjust their process. -> Testing and refining a solution through development
4. Teams are unable to respond to customer demands and incorporate solutions. They follow a strict plan and allow no room for flexibility or testing of new ideas. -> Adjusting team behavior to meet customer needs

Ariel is looking for a team to be an example of how to implement Scrum practices and share their practices and success with other teams in her company.
