> **Agile** is a value-driven approach to developing solutions. It is focused on people, adaptability, and providing maximum value to customers.

When you incorporate Agile ways of working, your team can respond to changing demands quickly and find efficiencies across your projects.

# Elements of Agile Development

The Agile philosophy emphasizes quick releases, flexible planning, sustainable development, continuous attention to good design, and ongoing feedback from users. Agility empowers your team to experiment and adapt to change quickly.

There is no prescriptive set of actions or processes that define Agile development. Rather, it begins with a mindset and encompasses the Agile values and principles. All these elements help teams implement practices that vary according to each team’s structure and resources.

## The Agile Mindset

The Agile mindset—a set of attitudes and ways of thinking that support Agile practices—enables independence, creativity, and innovation. It is the foundation that empowers average teams to transform into high-performing Agile teams.

- **Put Customers First**
People with an Agile mindset focus on delivering value to customers rather than prioritizing shareholders and generating revenue. Examining and understanding the customer perspective enables everyone in a team to concentrate on one goal and understand why they do the work they do.

- **Trust in the Team**
Rather than preferring to work within siloed departments and processes, team members with an Agile mindset value autonomy and are comfortable working in a self-managed team. They can work independently and get their work done with little direct supervision.

- **Emphasize Experimentation**
With an Agile mindset, people value creativity and look for opportunities to experiment and innovate. Team members with this mindset encourage the people around them to do the same. Engaging in experimentation means taking risks, which can lead to unique solutions and valuable outcomes.

## Agile Values

We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:

1.  **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools.

Success is determined by the team you work with and how well you work together, regardless of how well-researched your method is or how high-tech your tools are. Your team—and their ability to communicate efficiently—is more valuable than the processes they follow or the tools they use. For example, you can allow your team to define delivery processes such as sprint duration, let them assign their own tasks, and empower them to change processes and tools as needed.

2.  **Working software** over comprehensive documentation.

Before you write a single line of code, traditional software development processes often require considerable documentation. One of the values of Agile is to deliver working software—not documentation—into the customer's hands as quickly as possible. Early delivery of the working software helps get early feedback from the customer.

3.  **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation.

As business needs continue to change and increase in complexity, detailed contracts leave lots of room for misunderstandings about deliverables and overcomplicate the change-management process. In contrast, Agile emphasizes customer-centric product development in which a customer feedback loop is built into the development lifecycle. Continuous collaboration with customers helps ensure the delivery of effective and valuable solutions. For example, high-level goals are emphasized in contracts rather than detailed lists of requirements.

4.  **Responding to change** over following a plan.

Good Agile practices encourage regular evaluation and retooling of current plans based on new information, which is constantly gathered and analyzed. The product roadmap is not considered a static document but a dynamic strategy that allows the team to adjust its priorities and plans. For example, committing and delivering in small, incremental iterations allows teams to welcome changes in their backlog. Teams use relative size estimates of the backlog to quickly estimate sprint velocity and to determine how many sprints are needed to complete a set of features.

## Agile Principles

1.  Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
2.  Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.
3.  Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
4.  Businesspeople and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
5.  Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
6.  The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
7.  Working software is the primary measure of progress.
8.  Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
9.  Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
10.  Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential.
11.  The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
12.  At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

# Agile Ways of Working

As teams start to incorporate Agile—both the mindset and processes—they work in short iterations and focus on the **what, how, and why** of development work. Each of these elements empowers teams to engage in rapid iteration and focus on a central goal.

**What are you doing?**

To secure approval to create the checklist, you should typically contact either the project or account manager—depending on your client’s business—as some assistance from their side might be required. Most businesses are trying to earn money in an aggressive and competitive environment, which means they need to produce the right products and services and react quickly as the market changes. Your goal is to support the business—not only by following business requirements but by working together with other teams and using your skills, competency, and experience to collaborate on better solutions.

**How are you doing it?**

> Agile itself is not a set of practices and techniques; instead, Agile helps to identify the practices and techniques that will help you to work collaboratively and iteratively with the business on the common goal. Agile values and principles should guide your decisions about how you do your work.

# Shifting from Traditional Waterfall to Modern Agile Development

## Agile vs Waterfall Focus Areas

The Agile methodology seeks to streamline project work by focusing on three key areas: **adaptability, user experience,** and **testing**. 
Each of these focus points can help your team create a more holistic and streamlined design and development process.

Focus area|**Waterfall**|**Agile**
--|--|--
Adaptability|Provides a team with a complete view of the project process, goals, and strategies. This approach is organized and well-structured. Proceeding with clearly defined, orderly steps ensures that one piece of the project is finalized before moving on to the next.<br><br>However, due to its linear design, the waterfall methodology lacks adaptability throughout the development lifecycle, often leading to the need for wholesale changes once a solution is implemented.|Adopting Agile processes enables your team to develop and release iterative solutions to the market rapidly. Embracing change is foundational to Agile. Being flexible gives you the ability to respond to customer demands and incorporate new ideas, which increases the value of a solution.
User Experience|Establishes focused goals for creating a superior product for the end user and allows teams and project managers to move through each stage of the process without losing sight of those goals.<br><br>However, the rigidity of the waterfall method restricts the team’s ability to receive valuable end-user feedback until late in the development process. This can lead to developing a solution that doesn’t fix the problem and can cost your team and company valuable time and money trying to address concerns after the product has been fully developed.|Because Agile is iterative and continuous, your team gathers and implements customer feedback throughout the development process. Additionally, incorporating Agile processes and continually focusing on the user experience will ensure you and your client pay only for what the project requires. It enables you to prioritize the most valuable features and eliminate features you discover are not important, which helps control costs.
Testing|The linear approach of the waterfall methodology aims to keep a project on track to meet delivery dates and align with established project goals. The design ensures teams keep advancing through each stage without falling behind.<br><br>However, testing is delayed until late in the development lifecycle. As a result, teams don’t identify all—or even any—issues with the project until after the development process is complete. This late identification of issues leads to potentially costly backtracking to fix the problems.| Testing early and often enables your team to identify issues and resolve those issues as soon as possible. The ability to shift and change as needed lets you and your team alter paths and deliver better solutions. When solutions are tested and refined throughout development, the products you create are often higher-quality solutions that meet—and frequently exceed—customer expectations.

**Despite its drawbacks, there are times when a waterfall approach may still be the preferred approach, including when:**

1. The project/requirements/customer demand is not prone to change
2. The project is small in scope
3. The speed of delivery is not a priority

However, these situations are the exception—not the rule. To respond to evolving customer demands and keep up with constant change, software development teams and projects must transition to Agile.

# Best Practices for Agile

- Create and maintain a product backlog that is used as a single source for your tasks.
- Update and prioritize a backlog regularly with the team.
- Create a business roadmap aligned with the product backlog.
- Have regular sprint reviews.
- A Product Owner provides detailed positive or negative feedback on regular sprint reviews.
- Reprioritize a backlog based on the feedback from PO and stakeholders during regular demo/review sessions.
- Involve the whole team in the decision negotiations.
