> **Agile** is a value-driven approach to developing solutions. It is focused on people, adaptability, and providing maximum value to customers.

When you incorporate Agile ways of working, your team can respond to changing demands quickly and find efficiencies across your projects.

# Elements of Agile Development

The Agile philosophy emphasizes quick releases, flexible planning, sustainable development, continuous attention to good design, and ongoing feedback from users. Agility empowers your team to experiment and adapt to change quickly.

There is no prescriptive set of actions or processes that define Agile development. Rather, it begins with a mindset and encompasses the Agile values and principles. All these elements help teams implement practices that vary according to each team’s structure and resources.

## The Agile Mindset

The Agile mindset—a set of attitudes and ways of thinking that support Agile practices—enables independence, creativity, and innovation. It is the foundation that empowers average teams to transform into high-performing Agile teams.

- **Put Customers First**
People with an Agile mindset focus on delivering value to customers rather than prioritizing shareholders and generating revenue. Examining and understanding the customer perspective enables everyone in a team to concentrate on one goal and understand why they do the work they do.

- **Trust in the Team**
Rather than preferring to work within siloed departments and processes, team members with an Agile mindset value autonomy and are comfortable working in a self-managed team. They can work independently and get their work done with little direct supervision.

- **Emphasize Experimentation**
With an Agile mindset, people value creativity and look for opportunities to experiment and innovate. Team members with this mindset encourage the people around them to do the same. Engaging in experimentation means taking risks, which can lead to unique solutions and valuable outcomes.

## Agile Values

We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:

1.  **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools.

Success is determined by the team you work with and how well you work together, regardless of how well-researched your method is or how high-tech your tools are. Your team—and their ability to communicate efficiently—is more valuable than the processes they follow or the tools they use. For example, you can allow your team to define delivery processes such as sprint duration, let them assign their own tasks, and empower them to change processes and tools as needed.

2.  **Working software** over comprehensive documentation.

Before you write a single line of code, traditional software development processes often require considerable documentation. One of the values of Agile is to deliver working software—not documentation—into the customer's hands as quickly as possible. Early delivery of the working software helps get early feedback from the customer.

3.  **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation.

As business needs continue to change and increase in complexity, detailed contracts leave lots of room for misunderstandings about deliverables and overcomplicate the change-management process. In contrast, Agile emphasizes customer-centric product development in which a customer feedback loop is built into the development lifecycle. Continuous collaboration with customers helps ensure the delivery of effective and valuable solutions. For example, high-level goals are emphasized in contracts rather than detailed lists of requirements.

4.  **Responding to change** over following a plan.

Good Agile practices encourage regular evaluation and retooling of current plans based on new information, which is constantly gathered and analyzed. The product roadmap is not considered a static document but a dynamic strategy that allows the team to adjust its priorities and plans. For example, committing and delivering in small, incremental iterations allows teams to welcome changes in their backlog. Teams use relative size estimates of the backlog to quickly estimate sprint velocity and to determine how many sprints are needed to complete a set of features.

## Agile Principles

1.  Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
2.  Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.
3.  Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
4.  Businesspeople and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
5.  Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
6.  The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
7.  Working software is the primary measure of progress.
8.  Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
9.  Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
10.  Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential.
11.  The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
12.  At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.
