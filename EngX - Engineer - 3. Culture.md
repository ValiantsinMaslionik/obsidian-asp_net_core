# The Agile Engineer

**Engineers** are at the heart of all practices, processes, and tools that ensure successful delivery for a software development project. The behavior of Agile engineers - including their individual approach to work and the way they interact with other team members - plays a crucial role in delivering value to a client.

To enable a successful project delivery, Agile engineers work in **Agile teams**. One aspect of an Agile team is cross-functionality. 
A **cross-functional** team is comprised of specialists with expertise in different areas and whose skillsets complement those of the other team members.
Within these cross-functional teams, Agile engineers demonstrate key behavior patterns that foster productivity and quality.

### Acting with Empowerment and Motivation

Agile engineers and their teams are well aware of business goals and align all work with them. They acknowledge the importance of experimentation to reach those goals, and they are not afraid of failure. Commitment to continuous learning helps them remain open to new ideas and constant improvement of their skills, processes, and products.
They also feel empowered to make team decisions. This high degree of involvement in all processes boosts team motivation, collaboration, and productivity.

### Building Trust and Owning Actions

Being transparent is essential for ensuring effective communication with clients and team members because it builds trust. If mistakes happen, Agile engineers admit them and take steps to fix any issues. Effective use of tracking tools helps them support the transparency of their work. Owning their actions also means showing courage to do things that are right for a project. Project priorities or client needs might change, and Agile engineers need to assess them constantly. Courage helps them make necessary adjustments and produce relevant work outcomes.

### Being Able to Self-Organize

Cross-functional teams enable self-organization. These teams can adapt to business changes without needing a manager or external input; instead, they self-assign work tasks and effectively communicate with other team members to coordinate their actions and make appropriate decisions. They can also assess the skillset their team needs to deliver a valuable product to a client and apply their skills to meet project goals.

### Collaborating Effectively in a Team

Agile engineers demonstrate collective responsibility for teamwork and project outcomes.
They are accountable for achieving the end goal and delivering value to their clients as a team instead of just focusing on individual tasks. They also make significant contributions to the quality of a product by implementing Engineering Excellence practices, resolving project dependencies, and removing barriers.
These actions require constructive and trustworthy collaboration within Agile teams throughout a project.

# Thriving in a Culture of Engineering Excellence

Even though the term “EngX culture” emphasizes the engineering component, it extends far beyond the technical aspects of implementing engineering best practices. The practices - such as following code standards, peer reviews and pair programming, code refactoring, and automation, among others - play an important role in fostering and supporting agility. However, EngX culture is also an environment that empowers individual engineers and teams to behave and communicate in an Agile-driven way. In other words, EngX culture encompasses and shapes the entire range of hard and soft skills of its Agile engineers.

A culture of Engineering Excellence enables engineers to:
- Focus on delivering the highest business priority work items in a complex environment, which reduces work stress
- Develop new features instead of performing recurring manual tasks such as regression testing or deployments
- Reduce defects and rework with faster feedback cycles

#### Clear Alignment on Business Vision

An EngX culture provides a safe environment where all team members share a clear understanding of a project’s goals and roadmap, which ensures they focus on current priorities and produce meaningful outcomes.

#### Agile Leadership Support

Agile leadership is vital to establishing an EngX culture. Leaders must be flexible; enable an environment of trust, empowerment, collaboration; and support an infrastructure that helps teams commit to engineering excellence. Leaders must also acknowledge the contributions of every team member and foster an atmosphere where engineers are eager to share their experiences and learn from each other.

#### Optimal Project Environment

In an EngX culture, Agile teams adopt best engineering practices to approach the software development lifecycle in a way that enhances a client’s business agility and time to market, while maintaining the product’s quality.
An optimal combination of Agile practices, processes, and tools allows engineers to automate all repeatable tasks and focus on value creation throughout a project. This approach increases creativity and productivity, which leads to higher client satisfaction.

#### Agreement on the <span style="color:lime;">Definition of Done</span>

In a culture of Engineering Excellence, everyone - both teams and clients - agrees on a clear and unambiguous “**Definition of Done**”. Defining whether a particular task can be considered complete requires checking it against an established list of indicators. ==Engineers are typically responsible for creating this list from a technical perspective.== However, this process also requires consulting with clients and remaining transparent to avoid misunderstandings in the future.
By marking every new feature or release as done, your team can ensure consistent quality and code completeness, making it easier to track a project’s progress.

# Delivering Value to Clients

When Agile engineers operate in a culture of Engineering Excellence, the potential for their work to result in significant business benefits to a client increases significantly. Together, the individual engineers and the culture produce adaptable teams that are empowered to continuously meet clients’ changing needs, even in an unstable and challenging business environment.

Agile cross-functional teams deliver value to clients in three areas: time, quality, and reliability.

#### Time

Close collaboration between a client and a development team is crucial to releasing a product on time with the most valuable features incorporated. It also supports a quicker response to the client’s changing business needs, as Agile principles envisage optimization of all project processes. Some of them can happen in parallel to save time and make early client feedback available.

#### Quality

The focus of an Agile engineering culture is to produce a high-quality product for a client. When teams strive for engineering excellence, they can ensure high product quality without increasing development time and overall costs.

#### Reliability

Iterative and incremental development practices enable demonstration of the work progress to clients in real time. It helps Agile teams show their reliability by creating a transparent, trustworthy communication environment with their client. As a result, the clients can make business decisions with less risk.
