The **zero conditional** is a grammatical structure frequently used to express a **fact** or situation that is always true and does not change, regardless of the specific context or situation.
It can be used to describe _scientific principles_, _natural phenomena_, or _everyday experiences_.

## Zero Conditional: Structure

The basic structure of a zero type conditional is as follows:

- 'If **A**, _B_'  
- 'If + **condition**, _result_'

A and B are normally in the **[present simple tense](https://langeek.co/en/grammar/course/12/present-simple)**. 
The present simple tense is used to describe _facts_.

However, the **result** can also be in **[imperative mood](https://langeek.co/en/grammar/course/35/imperative)**
- *If you heat water, it boils.* 
 This is an example of zero conditionals. The condition always leads to the same result.

- *If you travel to London, go to the Buckingham Palace.* 
 Here, the result is in imperative mood.

## If Clauses

An '[if-clause](https://langeek.co/en/grammar/course/573/if-clauses)' is a type of conditional clause that begins with the word '**if**'. It is typically positioned at the _beginning_ of a sentence, and a **[comma](https://langeek.co/en/grammar/course/134/comma)** (,) should be used to separate it from the main [clause](https://langeek.co/en/grammar/course/256/clause), also known as the _result clause_.

- *If you mix red paint and yellow paint, you get orange paint.* 
 Here, 'if you mix red paint and yellow paint' is the 'if clause'. Note that there is a comma after the if clause. 'You get orange paint' is the result clause.

- *If you heat water to 100 degrees Celsius, it boils.*

> #### Punctuation
>
> It is possible to _reverse_ the order of the conditional sentence and state the **result** (the main clause) before the **condition** (the if-clause).
> It's important to note that in this order, no comma is used to separate the clauses.
>
> - *You burn your hand if you keep it close to fire.* 
> 'You burn your hand' is the result and 'if you keep it close to fire' is the if clause.

> ![[zICO - Warning - 16.png]] **We can use 'when' instead of 'if'.** 
> It won't change the meaning of the sentence.
> *When I don't clean my bedroom, my mom gets angry.* 

## Zero Conditional in the Past

You can use zero conditionals in the **[past simple tense](https://langeek.co/en/grammar/course/13/past-simple)** to talk about facts and situations that always happened in the past. 
This structure is used to talk about facts, routines, and habits that were **always true in the past.**

- *If I were sick, my parents took me to the family doctor.* 
- *If we had friends over, we ate outside.*
